Welcome to this amazing website built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io). Navigate a
little bit to see how everything works, and to start familiarizing yourself
with the site. If you look at the document, you'll see that you have several
ways of doing the same stuff. One is using markdown formatting, so **this for bold**,
*this for italic*.

In html, we'd do that with <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>, so markdown
does support directly including html content.

*Image and its caption, in italics*

Those are the basics of markdown, anything else, you might want to google *how to __ 
in markdown*. Have fun!
